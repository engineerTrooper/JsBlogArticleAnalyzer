## Using Gulp
In my setup I am using Gulp to compile SASS to compressed and uncompressed CSS. It's the same for JS.

The nodeJS setup and also the gulp files are not part of this repository. If you want to use the same settings in gulp like I do, please look in this repository: [nodeJsGulp](https://github.com/engineerTrooper/nodeJsGulp)
